redux-query-react is a library for making it easy to integrating redux-query with your React components.

## Why use redux-query?

- **It's simply Redux**: Follow best practices for storing and handling network state in Redux, with support for features like optimistic updates and cancellation. There's no magic here, just middleware, actions, selectors, and reducers.
- **It's extensible**: Built to fit most use cases out-of-the-box, but can easily be extended with custom Redux middleware, UI integrations, and network interfaces.
- **It works great with React**: With the provided React hooks and higher-order component in redux-query-react (optional), colocate data dependencies with your components and run requests when components mount or update.
